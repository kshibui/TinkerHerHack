Project Description:-
SheGuard is a web-based mental wellness tool designed specifically to support women through emotional self-awareness, stress assessment, and confidence building. It combines early detection of stress risk with interactive self-reflection tools and motivational support techniques — all through a friendly and easy-to-use interface.

Problem Statement:-
Modern life places significant emotional, academic, and social pressure on women — especially in tech, academics, and competitive environments such as hackathons. These pressures often go unnoticed until they become overwhelming because:
Stress builds gradually and silently.
Many women hesitate to seek help due to stigma.
There is a lack of simple tools focused on female emotional wellness.
SheGuard addresses this gap with a holistic digital experience that encourages proactive mental health awareness and confidence strengthening.
